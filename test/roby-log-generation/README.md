This is a minimal Roby app which is used to generate small logs, usable for the
roby index tests.

It is meant to be used by starting the `run` script with the name of one of the
scripts in `scripts/`. For instance,

~~~
./run event_emission
~~~

will refresh the Roby log `event_emission-events.log` which is stored in
`test/roby-logs`
